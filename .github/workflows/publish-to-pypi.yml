name: Publish Python Package to PyPI

# This workflow uses GitHub's OIDC trusted publishing to authenticate with PyPI.
# For this to work, you must configure trusted publishers on PyPI/TestPyPI:
# 1. Go to https://test.pypi.org/ or https://pypi.org/
# 2. Navigate to your project settings → Publishing
# 3. Add a new publisher with these details:
#    - Owner: alexlib
#    - Repository: pyptv
#    - Workflow: publish-to-pypi.yml
#    - Environment: testpypi (for TestPyPI) or pypi (for PyPI)
# 
# TROUBLESHOOTING:
# If you see "invalid-publisher" error, it means the trusted publisher is not configured
# correctly on PyPI/TestPyPI. The configuration MUST match these exact values:
# - Repository owner: alexlib
# - Repository name: pyptv  
# - Workflow filename: publish-to-pypi.yml (must be exact match)
# - Environment name: testpypi or pypi (must match exactly)
# 
# For detailed setup instructions, see DEPLOYMENT.md
